  summary: The Scientific Python Development Environment
  description: |
    Spyder is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python,
    and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts.
    It features a unique combination of the advanced editing, analysis,
    debugging and profiling functionality of a comprehensive development tool
    with the data exploration, interactive execution, deep inspection and
    beautiful visualization capabilities of a scientific package.
    Furthermore, Spyder offers built-in integration with many popular
    scientific packages, including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, IPython, QtConsole,
    Matplotlib, SymPy, and more.
    Beyond its many built-in features, Spyder can be extended even further via
    third-party plugins.
    Spyder can also be used as a PyQt5 extension library, allowing you to build
    upon its functionality and embed its components, such as the interactive
    console or advanced editor, in your own software.
